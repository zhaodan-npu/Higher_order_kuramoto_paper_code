1. Generate sequence

generate_levy.py: In conjunction with the .sh script, this generates a Lévy noise sequence with a scale consistent with the Kuramoto model. The output file includes time and noise_value.

generate_levy.sh

2. Identify spikes based on a threshold

extract_noise_spikes_global_2.py: Identifies spikes based on the 80th percentile threshold.

3. Segment into windows

window_3_noise.jl: Segments the data into different windows with an interval of 200. 

4. Calculate EDACF and EDSPEC for segmented windows

run_noise_windows.sh

submit_noise_batches.sh

process_noise_windows.jl

5. Plot the results

plot_window_5.py: Generates plots based on the calculation results.
