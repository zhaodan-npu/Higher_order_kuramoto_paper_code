For the response sequence:

distribution_2-copy: Segments the data based on spike events, calculates the inter-spike interval (ISI) distribution, and saves the data.

plot_fitting_3.py: Plots the Probability Density Function (PDF) based on the saved interval data.

For the noise sequence:

distribution_levy_2: Reads the spike data from the noise sequence and plots its PDF.
