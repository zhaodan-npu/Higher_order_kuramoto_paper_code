This figure is generated using a two-step, multi-language workflow. First, raw spike data is analyzed in parallel on an HPC cluster using Julia. Second, the results are aggregated, averaged, and plotted locally using Python.

We have already generated the raw spike data.

Analyze spike data to calculate the EDACF and EDSPEC:
